# Ermine

Super Easy Machine Learning Tool using TensorFlow.

## 1. What is Ermine?

Ermine is executor of the machine learning program which is composed from units.

You can edit the playlist with excellent GUI. You can edit it like the block play.

## 2.Installation

```
> pip install ermine

```

## 3.Short Example (Mnist)

At first, you have to run the server.

```
> ermine-web &

```

Open http://localhost:7007/  with your browser app.


Add mnist dataset.



Add CNN model.



Add Train Settings.



And execute !!




## 4. Training.

Press trainig tab.


add units for your training.

configurate your 

Machine learning trainig process will have units bellow.

|Ermine Unit|Unit Explanation| |
|:--|:--|:--|
|Dataset Unit|some dataset preparation kit such as mnist or your custom datasets| |
|Data Augument Unit|some dataset preparation kit such as mnist or your custom datasets| |
|Dataset Boost Unit|tune the machine learning input pipeline to be more faster| |
|Model Unit| | |
|Training Output Unit| | |

### 3.2. Inference/Test

|Ermine Unit|Unit Explanation| |
|:--|:--|:--|
|Dataset Unit|Dataset preparation unit such as mnist or your custom datasets.| |
|Inference Unit|Infer with datsets.| |
|Evaluation Output Unit|outputs result of the inferences in the specified format.|


## 5. Adding a new Ermine unit.

### 5.1. Create new unit.
